# Building a Call Center with Amazon Bedrock Assistant and Whisper for Voice-to-Text

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to create a call center solution that integrates Amazon Bedrock as an AI assistant and uses OpenAI's Whisper model for real-time voice-to-text transcription. The implementation will utilize Amazon SageMaker to deploy Whisper and Amazon Bedrock to enhance the interaction with AI-driven responses.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:
- An AWS account with access to Amazon SageMaker, Amazon S3, and Amazon Bedrock.
- Basic knowledge of Python and familiarity with AWS services.
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) and [SageMaker Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/studio/) set up on your machine.

## Architecture Overview

The architecture for the call center solution includes:
1. **Voice-to-Text Processing**: Using Whisper hosted on SageMaker for transcribing customer calls in real-time.
2. **AI Assistant**: Integrating Amazon Bedrock for providing AI-driven responses to the transcribed text.
3. **Communication Flow**: A simple flow that handles user queries, processes the transcription, and generates responses.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Deploy Whisper Model on Amazon SageMaker

1. **Save the Whisper Model to Amazon S3**
   - Convert the Whisper model to a serialized format (tar file) and upload it to an S3 bucket.

2. **Create a SageMaker Endpoint for Whisper**
   - Use the [notebook](./whisper-inference-deploy.ipynb) provided to create a SageMaker model object from the serialized Whisper model.
   - Deploy the model as a real-time endpoint with a custom inference script that handles audio-to-text transcription.

3. **Configure the Inference Script**
   - Ensure that the script correctly processes incoming audio signals and returns the transcribed text as output.

### Step 2: Integrate Amazon Bedrock as the AI Assistant

1. **Configure Amazon Bedrock**
   - Set up Amazon Bedrock in your AWS account to act as the AI assistant. 
   - You can create a conversational agent that processes the transcribed text from Whisper and generates intelligent responses.

2. **Set Up API Communication**
   - Establish communication between the SageMaker endpoint and Amazon Bedrock, ensuring that the transcribed text is passed to Bedrock for generating responses.

3. **Handle AI Responses**
   - Integrate the responses from Bedrock into the call center workflow, delivering them back to the caller in real time.

### Step 3: Testing and Optimization

1. **Send Audio Signals for Transcription**
   - Test the call center by sending real-time audio signals to the SageMaker endpoint for transcription.
   - Verify the accuracy of the transcription and analyze the AI-generated responses from Bedrock.

2. **Optimize and Scale**
   - Optimize your SageMaker endpoint for lower latency and cost efficiency.
   - Use SageMaker's monitoring tools to track performance and make any necessary adjustments.

### Step 4: Clean Up Resources

1. **Delete the SageMaker Endpoint**
   - Once testing is complete, ensure you delete the SageMaker endpoint to avoid incurring unnecessary costs.

2. **Remove Other Resources**
   - Clean up any additional AWS resources created during this process, such as Amazon S3 buckets or temporary files.

## Example Workflow

Below is an example of how a call center interaction might flow:

1. **Caller**: Asks a question or provides information over the phone.
2. **Whisper**: Transcribes the audio into text using the SageMaker real-time endpoint.
3. **Bedrock**: Processes the transcribed text and generates a response using the AI assistant.
4. **Response**: The call center agent receives the AI-generated response to relay to the caller.
